In C, a function is equivalent to a subroutine or function in Fortran, or a
procedure or function in Pascal. A function provides a convenient way to
encapsulate some computation, which can then be used without worrying about
its implementation. With properly designed functions, it is possible to ignore
how a job is done; knowing what is done is sufficient. C makes the use of functions
easy, convenient and efficient; you will often see a short function defined
and called only once, just because it clarifies some piece of code.
